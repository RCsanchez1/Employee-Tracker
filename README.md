# Employee Tracker (Content Management System)
This command-line application manages a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.




### Prerequisites
  * Git terminal
  * Node
  * MySQL and MySQL Workbench (or the terminal instead of MySQL Workbench)



## Running the tests
There is no automated test suite for this command line application. Instead, I ran the following manual tests. 

### Manual tests
    1. "View all employees"
    2. "View all employees by department"
    3. "View all roles"
    4. "View all departments"
    5. "Add department" followed by "View all departments" to confirm that the new department is there.
    6. "Add employee" followed by "View all employees" to confirm that the new employee is there. 
    7. "Add role" followed by "View all roles" to confirm.
    8. "Remove employee" followed by "View all employees" to confirm.
